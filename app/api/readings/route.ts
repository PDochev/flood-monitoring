// Why it's necessary for FloodWatch:
// Data Freshness: Ensures that users always receive the most up-to-date readings for the station.
// Bypassing Static Generation: Next.js by default tries to optimize routes by statically generating them at build time where possible. For an API that serves real-time data, this would result in stale data.
